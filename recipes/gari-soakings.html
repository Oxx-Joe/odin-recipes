    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Gari soakings is a popular Ghanaian food loved especially by students due to its affordability,
            ease of preparation and great taste. It only requires five ingredients. To all my "lack-toes-in-to-ler-ant"
            and peanut allergic people, please check out my other recipes.
